# E-Sports Competition Management System

**Academic Programming Project | C Language**

A comprehensive console-based application for managing electronic sports competitions and participant data. This project demonstrates proficiency in file I/O operations, data structures, and structured programming principles in C.

## Project Overview

This application provides a complete management system for e-sports competitions, allowing organizers to efficiently handle participant registration, scoring, status tracking, and comprehensive reporting through an intuitive console interface.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Features
- **Interactive Console Menu System** with 10 operational functions
- **Binary File Management** for persistent data storage (`participanti.dat`)
- **Participant Registration System** with structured data model:
  - ID (unique identifier)
  - Name
  - Game
  - Score
  - Participation fee
  - Status (active/inactive)

### CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Participant registration and file initialization
- **Read**: Search and display participant information
- **Update**: Score modifications and status changes
- **Delete**: Logical deletion through status management

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Search & Filtering**: 
  - Search by participant ID
  - Filter by score and fee criteria
- **Comprehensive Reporting System**:
  - Complete participant reports
  - Filtered reports based on custom criteria
  - Multiple output formats (plain text and tabular)
- **Sequential File Processing** using `fread()`, `fwrite()`, `fseek()`
- **Data Validation** and comprehensive error handling
- **Modular Function-Based Architecture** for maintainable code

## Technical Skills

- **File I/O Operations**: Binary file handling and data persistence
- **Data Structures**: Efficient participant data organization
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic data handling and optimization
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation and exception management
- **Modular Programming**: Clean, maintainable code architecture
- **Console Interface Design**: User-friendly menu-driven interaction

## Reporting Features

The system generates multiple types of reports:
- **Complete Reports**: Full participant database export
- **Filtered Reports**: Custom criteria-based data extraction
- **Tabular Formatting**: Professional-style formatted output
- **Plain Text Output**: Simple, readable data presentation
